  Extracted from `kotobase-peer.statistics` (which is itself pure and
  dependency-free -- `clojure.set` only) alongside the model half of
  `kotobase-peer.core`. Only the three functions the model half actually
  calls are here; the histogram/join-planner/materialized-arrangement half of
  that namespace is about persisted manifests and index runs, which is
  persistence, and stays there.

  All functions return immutable data. No effects are executed here."
