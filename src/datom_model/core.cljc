(ns datom-model.core
  "The Datomic-shaped model over a `datalog.index` db value: transact,
  schema-as-datoms, datoms, q/query, pull, entity, entid/ident.

  Extracted verbatim-in-behavior from the FIRST HALF of
  `kotoba-lang/kotobase-peer`'s `kotobase-peer.core` (`empty-db` through
  `ident`, up to but not including `snapshot!`). Everything from `snapshot!`
  onward in that namespace -- `commit!`, `fold!`, `hydrate-*`, `as-of`/
  `since`/`history`, `cold-datoms`, `verify-chain` -- is the persistence half
  and is deliberately NOT here. This namespace never puts, gets, hashes,
  addresses, or chains anything: a db value goes in, a db value or a query
  result comes out.

  What that buys: the transitive runtime closure is `datalog` + `datom`
  (whose own closure is `datom-source`). No prolly-tree, no chain, no IPLD,
  no CBOR, no multiformats.

  ## Two injected parameters, both REQUIRED

  `ref?` -- the predicate deciding whether a value is a REFERENCE, i.e.
  whether it (a) survives quad coercion verbatim instead of being
  stringified and (b) gets a reverse-reference (`:vaet`) index entry.
  `kotobase-peer` defaulted it to `ipld.core/link?`, which was the only
  reason its model half needed IPLD at all. `datalog.index` already made
  `ref?` required for exactly this reason (see its README's \"The one cut\");
  this namespace follows, rather than inventing a new implicit default --
  every candidate default is a guess about the caller's data model, and a
  wrong guess silently yields an empty or over-full reverse index.

  `render-value` (on `datoms`) -- how a stored `:o` becomes the `:v_edn` wire
  string. `kotobase-peer` hardcoded `#(pr-str (arrangement.core/link->edn %))`,
  the second and last IPLD coupling in the model half. Also required, for the
  same reason `visible?` is: a permissive default (`pr-str`) would silently
  emit `#object[...Link 0x...]` garbage into `:v_edn` for any caller who
  forgot, which is worse than an arity error. To reproduce `kotobase-peer`'s
  exact wire bytes, pass `#(pr-str (arrangement.core/link->edn %))`.

  `visible?` is required everywhere it appears, unchanged from the source
  (ADR-2607050500: query is a first-class effect all the way up this stack).
  Pass `(constantly true)` to see everything, as an explicit choice."

(defn datoms
  "`datomic.datoms`-shaped rows `{:e :a :v_edn :added}`.

   `render-value` is REQUIRED: it turns a stored `:o` into the `:v_edn` wire
   string (see the ns docstring). `pr-str` is the identity-ish choice for a
   db whose values are all strings; a caller with reference values must
   render them itself.

   `visible?` is REQUIRED (ADR-2607050500). It is applied as a post-filter
   over each candidate ROW, i.e. `(visible? {:e :a :v_edn :added})` -- the
   same `datomic.datoms`-shaped map this fn returns, NOT `datalog.query`'s
   `{:s :p :o}` quad shape (`:e`/`:a` name the same positions as `:s`/`:p`,
   but `:v_edn` is already the wire-encoded string, not the raw stored value,
   and `:added` is present too) -- a caller filtering by entity/attribute (the
   common case: can this actor see this entity, is this attribute public)
   needs no decoding to do so; a caller that must decide on the raw value can
   `clojure.edn/read-string` `:v_edn` itself. Pass `(constantly true)` to see
   everything, as an explicit choice.

   3-arg (`[db render-value visible?]`) → whole-db (`:eavt` full scan). 4-arg
   additionally honors an optional `{:index :components :limit}` via the index
   accessors, so a filtered read (e.g. by entity, or by `[attr value]`)
   materialises ONLY the matching entity/attr instead of the whole graph.

   `:index` ∈ `#{:eavt :aevt :avet :vaet}` (default `:eavt`); `:components` is
   an ordered prefix in that index's key order (`:eavt`=[e a v],
   `:aevt`/`:avet`=[a …], `:vaet`=[v a …] -- reverse-reference only, populated
   for `ref?`-valued quads). `visible?` is applied BEFORE `:limit` is taken,
   so `:limit` caps the row count the caller actually receives (all of them
   visible), not the count of raw candidates scanned."
